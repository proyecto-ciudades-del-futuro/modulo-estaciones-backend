## Introduction
***
Modulo Estaciones will integrate with the Ciudades del Futuro project to set up an IoT network of air quality monitoring
stations across Argentina's territory.

## Installation
***
### INSTALLATION AND RUNNING

 **Note: You must have Docker Compose and/or Docker Desktop installed in your machine**


##### A) Mount and run Orion Context Broker


1) Step on your local folder where the docker-compose.yml file is, open a new terminal and run:
```docker-compose up``` or ```sudo docker-compose up``` if your machine requires superuser privileges


2) Step on the root directory and run the following command to ensure that the counters-initialization.sh script can be run by node:
```chmod +x ./scripts/counters_initialization.sh```

3) Also, on the same dir run ```chmod +x ./scripts/populate_orion.sh```

4) Initialize the counters with:
 
    ```
    MAC/LINUX
    npm run devInit

    WINDOWS: in a GIT BASH or LINUX BASH
    ./scripts/counters_initialization.sh
   ```

##### B) Start the Express runtime

1) If you don't have Typescript install it globally or locally:
```npm install -g ts-node``` or 
```npm install -g ts-node```

2) run
````npm install```` to add every dependency

3) run ````npm run dev````

4) Populate the Orion Context to have data to play with
   ```
   MAC/LINUX
   npm run devPopulate

   WINDOWS: in a GIT BASH or LINUX BASH
   ./scripts/populate_orion.sh


READY!

Now you will have the ExpressJS server, the Orion Context Broker and the MongoDB ready to start with locally



@@ Important guidelines to interact with ORION CONTEXT BROKER API:

https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/2.4.0/user/walkthrough_apiv2/index.html

## Counters initialization
***
Due to the abscence of an "order-by" capabilty from Orion Context Broker, the Id's generation is handled via a counter that's initialized for the Station, Sensor and User entities. The counters initialization is handled by the
```counters_initialization.sh``` script located on the
```scripts/``` directory.


## Troubleshooting

***
DOCKER
---

If you have issues with your docker instances, try to reinitialize them via the following commands:

1. List the running containers running
   `docker ps` in the terminal. That command will list every running container along with their container IDs and other
   details
2. Copy the container IDs of the Orion/MongoDB instances and run this command `docker stop <container_id>`
3. Verify that the containers have stopped with `docker ps`
4. Now remove the stopped containers with `docker rm <container_id>`
5. Verify that the containers have been removed with: `docker ps -a`
6. Run again your docker instances

# Orion Context Broker Data Structures

### General rule for entities definition:

To ensure compatibility with the *Orion Context Broker*, each entity must adhere to the subsequent structure:

- id: identifier (unique String)
- type: String
- Attributes: each attribute has to be defined as an JSON object.

For example:

```
{
    "id": "station_1",
    "type": Station,
    "sensors": {
        type: "StructuredValue",
        "value": [
            {
                "id": "sensor_4",
                "type": "Sensor"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

As you see, in the previous example, the id and type keys can have a direct value, but attributes must be defined as
JSON objects with their corresponding keys.

    "id": "station_1",

## Query Station by Id

- <u>HTTP Method</u>: `GET`
- <u>Endpoint URL</u>: `/stations/:id`

## Query used Station ids service

- <u>HTTP Method</u>: `GET`
- <u>Endpoint URL</u>: `/stations/?fields=id`

## Create Station

##### Creating a Station Entity: POST Request

To create a Station entity, send a POST request to the designated API endpoint you should comply with the following data
structure of the payload since the server will interact with ORION interface.

### Request Body

The request body is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- `description` (object): a description of the station, with the following attributes:
    - `metadata` (object): any additional metadata associated with the description (optional)
    - `value` (string): the description text
- `location` (object): the geographic location of the station, with the following attributes:
    - `coordinates` (Array<number[2]):  `[51.5074,
      -0.1278]`
    - `metadata` (object): any additional metadata associated with the location (optional)
- `user` (object): the user associated with the station, with the following attributes:
    - `value` (integer): the user identifier
    - `metadata` (object): any additional metadata associated with the user (optional)

By default, a new station will be created with the STATION_STATE attribute set as "ENABLED" and an empty Array of
sensors.

### Example Request:

```
POST /stations HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "description": {
        "metadata": {},
        "value": "This is a test station"
    },

    },
    "user": {
        "value": 1,
    }
}
```

## Update Station

- <u>HTTP Method</u>: `PATCH`
- <u>Endpoint URL</u>: `/stations/:id`
- <u>Headers</u>: Content-Type</u>: `application/json`

To update a Station entity, the verb to be used is `PATCH`, any attributes excepting the station_id and STATION_STATE
can be modified

### EXAMPLE REQUEST:

```
PATCH /stations/station_20 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "sensors": {
      "value": [{
          "station_id": "station_1",
          "id": "sensor_1",
