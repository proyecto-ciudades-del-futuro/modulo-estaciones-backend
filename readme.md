## Introduction

Modulo Estaciones will integrate with the Ciudades del Futuro project to set up an IoT network of air quality monitoring stations across Argentina's territory.

## Installation

### INSTALLATION AND RUNNING
 TWO MAIN METHODS



##### A) Automatic and Recommended (Using Docker Compose)

(Note: you need Docker Compose and/or Docker Desktop installed in your machine)

1) Step on your local folder where the docker-compose.yml file is and run:

```sudo docker-compose up```

2) Check that everything works by running this command on your terminal:
   ```curl localhost:1026/version```


##### B) Manually Installing and running images
***
1) Install Docker Desktop
2) Run the following commands to download the required docker images:
```
docker pull mongo:4.4
docker pull fiware/orion
```
3) Create a network for the containers to connect
```
docker network create fiware_default
```
4) Run the MongoDB Docker Container with:
```
docker run -d --name=mongo-db --network=fiware_default \
  --expose=27017 mongo:4.4 --bind_ip_all
```
5) Start Orion Context Broker
```
docker run -d --name fiware-orion -h orion --network=fiware_default \
  -p 1026:1026  fiware/orion -dbhost mongo-db
```

Now you will have both the Orion Context Broker and the MongoDB ready to start with locally

# Stations / Estaciones

## Query Every Station
- <u>HTTP Method:</u> `GET`
- <u>Endpoint URL:</u> `/stations/`

## Query Station by Id
- <u>HTTP Method</u>: `GET`
- <u>Endpoint URL</u>: `/stations/:id`

## Query used Station ids service
- <u>HTTP Method</u>: `GET`
- <u>Endpoint URL</u>: `/stations/?fields=id`

## Create Station
- <u>HTTP Method</u>: `POST`
- <u>Endpoint URL</u>: `/stations/`
- <u>Headers</u>: Content-Type</u>: `application/json`


##### Creating a Station Entity: POST Request
To create a Station entity, send a POST request to the designated API endpoint you should comply with the following data structure of the payload since the server will interact with ORION interface.


### Request Body

The request body is a JSON object with the following attributes:

- `id` (string): a unique identifier for the Station entity. The format of the id should be "station_xx" (xx being a number from 1, no leading zero's are allowed)
- `description` (object): a description of the station, with the following attributes:
    - `type` (string): the data type of the description, which should be "String"
    - `metadata` (object): any additional metadata associated with the description (optional)
    - `value` (string): the description text
- `location` (object): the geographic location of the station, with the following attributes:
    - `type` (string): the data type of the location, which should be "geo:json"
    - `value` (object): a GeoJSON object representing the location
    - `metadata` (object): any additional metadata associated with the location (optional)
- `user` (object): the user associated with the station, with the following attributes:
    - `type` (string): the data type of the user, which should be "Integer"
    - `value` (integer): the user identifier
    - `metadata` (object): any additional metadata associated with the user (optional)

By default, a new station will be created with the STATION_STATE attribute set as "ENABLED" and an empty Array of sensors.

### Example Request:

```
POST /stations HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "station_3",
    "description": {
        "type": "String",
        "metadata": {},
        "value": "This is a test station"
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "geo:json",
        "value": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                51.5074,
                -0.1278
            ]
        },
        "metadata": {}
    },
    "user": {
        "type": "Integer",
        "value": 1,
        "metadata": {}
    }
}
```

## Update Station

- <u>HTTP Method</u>: `PATCH`
- <u>Endpoint URL</u>: `/stations/:id`
- <u>Headers</u>: Content-Type</u>: `application/json`

To update a Station entity, the verb to be used is `PATCH`, any attributes excepting the station_id and STATION_STATE can be modified

### EXAMPLE REQUEST:


```
PATCH /stations/station_20 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "sensors": {
      "value": [{
          "station_id": "station_1",
          "id": "sensor_1",
          "type": "Temperature"
      }]
    }
}
```
